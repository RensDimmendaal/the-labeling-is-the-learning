# the Labeling IS the Learning 

In this repo I share a notebook that shows some tricks for interactive labeling on text data.
This is especially useful when you're still creating the taxonomy for your text classification problem.

I demo'ed this notebook at work and people asked for it so there it is. It's not the neatest piece of work but I hope it can serve as inspiration for your own tooling.

## Other great resoources

Much of what's discussed here came from discussions with https://github.com/koaning/, you can check out his work below: it's much better packaged.
